# 🏦 Bank Marketing Insights – Predictive Analysis (Python)

## 🎯 Project Purpose
This project analyses marketing campaign data from a banking institution to identify patterns influencing customer subscription behavior to help predict future customer subscription behaviour.  
It highlights my ability to use **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Machine Learning** for predictive insights.

## 📊 Overview
Using a real-world marketing dataset, this notebook explores demographic and campaign factors affecting client responses to term-deposit offers and the influence on long-term subscriptions.  
The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature visualisation, and predictive modeling.

### Key Objectives
- Explore patterns behind successful marketing outcomes  
- Visualize relationships between client demographics and campaign results  
- Build and evaluate a classification model

## 💬 About Me
I am an individual looking to transition into data analysis through a strong passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive strategic decisions.
My work focuses on uncovering trends, optimising performance, and creating clear visual stories that connect data to real-world impact.
I enjoy exploring data across domains — from business operations and customer behavior to marketing performance and financial trends.
I’m experienced with tools such as Excel, SQL, and Python, and I’m comfortable handling end-to-end analytics workflows: data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualisation.
As I continue to develop I am expanding my learning into new analytical techniques (machine learning and AI), experimenting with visualisation tools, or studying real-world business cases to better understand how data informs decision-making.
